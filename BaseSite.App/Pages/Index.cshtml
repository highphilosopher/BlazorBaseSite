<h1>Base Site Template</h1>
<h2>
    Welcome to my Base Site Template!
</h2>

<p>
    This is a simple extension on top of the default Blazor template. It's fairly straight forward with a couple pieces added.
</p>
<p>
    Additions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Authentication/Authorization system
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Auth built-in.</li>
        <li>Stores passwords hashed with dynamic salt. (uses bcrypt hashing).</li>
        <li>Permissions are simple string-based. Examples of implementing can be seen on the Account pages.</li>
        <li>default username is test@test.com. Password is test. Please remove this. Seriously!</li>
        <li>Users stored in userStore.json in the Server project.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>NotADAL data persistence
    <ul>
        <li>For the sake of prototyping I didn't want to mess with setting up a DAL.</li>
        <li>The Persistence folder in the App project contains a KeyedDataStore class. It extends a generic Dictionary.</li>
        <li>Basically you inherit from it, pick a file name, and it'll handle the serialization via json back and forth.</li>
        <li>Persistence happens when items are updated or removed. If you modify properties of items in the collections, you can call Persist() manually.</li>
        <li>You can't complain about the performance of the DAL, cause it's NotADAL :)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    That's pretty much it! Easy to prototype with Blazor. Just enough Authentication to feel ok with publishing to Azure for testing.
</p>

    The cookie authentication piece is a great piece of functionality. It came from this article on <a href="http://lightswitchhelpwebsite.com/Blog/tabid/61/EntryId/4316/A-Demonstration-of-Simple-Server-side-Blazor-Cookie-Authentication.aspx" target="_blank">Light Switch</a> article (opens in a new window).
    Michael Washington, you're awesome!
</p>
<p>
    BCrypt.NET, cause I'm not actually smart enough to implement bcrypt myself (obviously).
</p>
<p>
    Obviously the base template here is from the Blazor team! Dear giants, we love standing on your shoulders!
